# ImmersiveAdventuring

A side mod about Immersive Engineering

Big machines solve everything? Bored in immersive engineering? The blessing of industry makes you so strong that you have nothing to do? Try Immersive adventuring!

Based on the large number of industrial machines provided by IE, we have expanded our wide range of items and equipment! To make the late survival more playable, we have added some mechanics such as machine failure in the late stage. We also added some creatures, as well as creature forces (neutral, hostile); We've also added a BOSS!

Of course, the premise of exploring all this is that the player has developed a good IE foundation, so rest assured that we will do a good balance of playability. Also, unlike IP, this mod does not add content to the engineer's manual, only the achievement system as the only clue, because the idea is to give players as much freedom and playability as possible under a theme. However, all exploration clues will eventually lead to the core theme of our mod, which players will discover step by step in their exploration and understand it all after defeating the boss

Mods are in the development stage, so please understand that the progress may be slow; Welcome to give us valuable suggestions and criticisms!
